INTRODUCTION TO OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which can represent real-world entities or abstract concepts. This section provides an introduction to the fundamental principles and advantages of OOP.

CLASSES AND OBJECTS

Classes and objects are the building blocks of OOP. They allow you to model real-world entities or concepts as software objects. This section explains how to define classes, create objects, and work with their properties and behaviors.

INHERITANCE

Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that enables the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes. This section covers the concepts of inheritance, superclass and subclass, method overriding, and more.

POLYMORPHISM

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in the design and implementation of software systems. This section explores the concepts of polymorphism, method overloading, method overriding, and dynamic binding.

ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding internal implementation details of an object and exposing a well-defined interface for interacting with it. It helps achieve data abstraction, modularity, and maintainability. This section explains how to encapsulate data and behavior within classes and use access modifiers effectively.

ABSTRACTION

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential aspects and hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to create abstract classes and interfaces that define common behaviors and characteristics. This section explores abstract classes, abstract methods, and interfaces.

INTERFACES

Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement specific behaviors without specifying the implementation details. They provide a way to achieve multiple inheritances and enable loose coupling between components. This section covers interfaces, default methods, static methods, and their usage in Java.

PACKAGES

Packages are used to organize classes, interfaces, and other resources into meaningful groups. They help manage naming conflicts, control access, and provide a logical structure to the codebase. This section explains how to create and organize packages and import classes from different packages.
